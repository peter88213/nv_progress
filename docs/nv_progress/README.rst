**User guide**

This page refers to the latest `nv_progress
<https://github.com/peter88213/nv_progress/>`__ release.
You can open it with **Help > Progress viewer Online help**.

The plugin adds a **Daily progress log** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools** menu.


Installing the plugin
---------------------

- Either launch the downloaded **nv_progress_vx.x.x.pyzw**
  file by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop),
- or execute ```python nv_progress_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Windows),
  resp. ```python3 nv_progress_vx.x.x.pyzw``` (Linux)
  on the command line.

*"x.x.x"* means the version number.


.. important::
   Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file 
   and offer to open it immedately. 
   This starts the installation.
 
   However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
   initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
   In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
   If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
   the zip file. 

   
Launch the program
------------------

- Open the progress log viewer from the main menu: **Tools > Daily progress log**.


Update today's word count
-------------------------

- If the *nv_progress* window is already open, you can update the actual word count with **Tools > Daily progress log**.
