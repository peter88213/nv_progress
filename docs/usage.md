# Installation

- Unzip the downloaded zipfile into a new folder.
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.py**. This installs the plugin.

*Note: If you install novelibre at a later time, you can always install the plugin afterwards by running the nv_progress/ setup script again.*

The plugin adds a **Daily progress log** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools** menu. 
When a project is being opened, *nv_progress* makes sure the word count logging is activated.
